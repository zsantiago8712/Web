                    In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide
                    variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.
                    On a spectrum of computational cost and visual fidelity, ray tracing-based rendering techniques,
                    such as
                    ray casting, recursive ray tracing, distribution ray tracing, photon mapping and path tracing, are
                    generally slower and higher fidelity than scanline rendering methods. Thus, ray tracing was first
                    deployed in applications where taking a relatively long time to render could be tolerated, such as
                    in
                    still computer-generated images, and film and television visual effects (VFX), but was less suited
                    to
                    real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame

                    In computer graphics, a computer graphics pipeline, rendering pipeline or simply graphics pipeline,
                    is a conceptual model that describes what steps a graphics system needs to perform to render a 3D
                    scene to a 2D screen. Once a 3D model has been created, for instance in a video game or any other
                    3D computer animation, the graphics pipeline is the process of turning that 3D model into what the
                    computer displays. Because the steps required for this operation depend on the software and
                    hardware used and the desired display characteristics, there is no universal graphics pipeline
                    suitable for all cases. However, graphics application programming interfaces (APIs) such as Direct3D
                    and OpenGL were created to unify similar steps and to control the graphics pipeline of a given
                    hardware accelerator. These APIs abstract the underlying hardware and keep the programmer away from
                    writing code to manipulate the graphics hardware accelerators (AMD/Intel/NVIDIA etc.).

                    The model of the graphics pipeline is usually used in real-time rendering. Often, most of the
                    pipeline steps are implemented in hardware, which allows for special optimizations. The term
                    "pipeline" is used in a similar sense to the pipeline in processors: the individual steps of the
                    pipeline run in parallel as long as any given step has what it needs.

                        Ray casting is the methodological basis for 3D CAD/CAM solid modeling and image rendering. It is
                        essentially the same as ray tracing for computer graphics where virtual light rays are "cast" or
                        "traced" on their path from the focal point of a camera through each pixel in the camera sensor
                        to
                        determine what is visible along the ray in the 3D scene. The term "Ray Casting" was introduced
                        by
                        Scott Roth while at the General Motors Research Labs from 1978 1980. His paper, "Ray Casting for
                        Modeling Solids", describes modeled solid objects by combining primitive solids, such as
                        blocks
                        and cylinders, using the set operators union (+), intersection (&), and difference (-). The
                        general
                        idea of using these binary operators for solid modeling is largely due to Voelcker and
                        Requicha's
                        geometric modelling group at the University of Rochester. See Solid modeling for a broad
                        overview of solid modeling methods. This figure on the right shows a U-Joint modeled from
                        cylinders
                        and blocks in a binary tree using Roth's ray casting system, circa 1979.

                    3D computer graphics, sometimes called CGI, 3D-CGI or three-dimensional computer graphics are
                    graphics that use a three-dimensional representation of geometric data (often Cartesian) that is
                    stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering digital images,
                    usually 2D images but sometimes 3D images. The resulting images may be stored for viewing later
                    (possibly as an animation) or displayed in real time.

                    3D computer graphics, contrary to what the name suggests, are most often displayed on
                    two-dimensional displays. Unlike 3D film and similar techniques, the result is two-dimensional,
                    without visual depth. More often, 3D graphics are being displayed on 3D displays, like in virtual
                    reality systems.

                    3D graphics stand in contrast to 2D computer graphics which typically use completely different
                    methods and formats for creation and rendering.

                    3D computer graphics rely on many of the same algorithms as 2D computer vector graphics in the
                    wire-frame model and 2D computer raster graphics in the final rendered display. In computer graphics
                    software, 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and similarly,
                    3D may use some 2D rendering techniques.

                    The objects in 3D computer graphics are often referred to as 3D models. Unlike the rendered image, a
                    model's data is contained within a graphical data file. A 3D model is a mathematical representation
                    of any three-dimensional object; a model is not technically a graphic until it is displayed. A model
                    can be displayed visually as a two-dimensional image through a process called 3D rendering, or it
                    can be used in non-graphical computer simulations and calculations. With 3D printing, models are
                    rendered into an actual 3D physical representation of themselves, with some limitations as to how
                    accurately the physical model can match the virtual model.

                    A graphics library is a program library designed to aid in rendering computer graphics to a monitor.
                    This typically involves providing optimized versions of functions that handle common rendering
                    tasks. This can be done purely in software and running on the CPU, common in embedded systems, or
                    being hardware accelerated by a GPU, more common in PCs. By employing these functions, a program can
                    assemble an image to be output to a monitor. This relieves the programmer of the task of creating
                    and optimizing these functions, and allows them to focus on building the graphics program. Graphics
                    libraries are mainly used in video games and simulations.

                    The use of graphics libraries in connection with video production systems, such as Pixar RenderMan,
                    is not covered here.

                <p>
                    Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API, open standard for 3D graphics and
                    computing.[16][17][18] Vulkan targets high-performance real-time 3D graphics applications, such as
                    video games and interactive media. Vulkan is intended to offer higher performance and more efficient
                    CPU and GPU usage compared to older OpenGL and Direct3D 11 APIs. It provides a considerably
                    lower-level API for the application than the older APIs, making Vulkan comparable to Apple's Metal
                    API and Microsoft's Direct3D 12. In addition to its lower CPU usage, Vulkan is designed to allow
                    developers to better distribute work among multiple CPU cores.
